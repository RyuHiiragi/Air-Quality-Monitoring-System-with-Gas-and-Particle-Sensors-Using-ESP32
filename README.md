# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System-with-Gas-and-Particle-Sensors-Using-ESP32
This guide explains how to build a real-time air quality monitoring system using the ESP32 microcontroller to measure gas concentrations (CO2, CO, NH3) and particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10) , then transmit data to a cloud dashboard for analysis .
